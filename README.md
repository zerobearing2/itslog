itslog
======

`itslog` is a log formatter designed to aid rails development.

The formatting will prepend all log statements with a colored header and additional information about the statement. The information and structure of the new statements is customizable through configuration.

[timestamp] [rails namespace] [log message], example:

Errors and warnings will also stand out, example:

In addition to more readable logs, you can tail and grep specific parts of your application. example:

    tail -f log/development.log | grep active_record

Use itslog in conjunction with [axe](http://github.com/johmas/axe) for faster access to your logs.

Install
-------

Add to your Gemfile in Rails:

``` ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'itslog'
end
```

Configure
-----------

Itslog does not need to be configured unless you want to customize the output structure and color.

Example:

``` ruby
Itslog.configure do |config|
    config.namespace_colors = {
      'action_controller' => "\e[32m",
      'active_record'     => "\e[94m",
      'mongo'             => "\e[94m",
      'action_view'       => "\e[36m"
    }
    config.format = "%t [%n]: %m"
    config.message_color = "\e[37m"
    config.timestamp_format = "%Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S %z"
end
```

Configure format by building a string anyway you'd like and using the following variables:

    %t (timestamp)
    %n (namespace)
    %m (log message)

Configure time format using a strftime format string. [foragoodstrftime](http://www.foragoodstrftime.com/) is a nice reference.

I don't recommend coloring by severity because it's not very useful. To color by severity instead of the default of namespace:

``` ruby
Itslog.configure do |config|
  config.color_by :severity
  # debug, info, warning, error, fatal, unknown
  config.severity_colors = ["\e[36m","\e[32m","\e[33m","\e[31m","\e[31m","\e[37m"]
end
```

Place the configuration in an initializer:

    config/initializers/itslog.rb
